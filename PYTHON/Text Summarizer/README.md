## âœ” TEXT SUMMARIZER
- A "Text Summarizer" is an application created in python with tkinter gui.
- In this application, user will be able summarize any big paragrah or text.
- We need this application because long paragraph and huge text are sometimes very tough to read and understand.
- So using TEXT SUMMARIZER, we summarize the paragraph in brief.
- for implementing this user nltk library in python.

### REQUIREMENTS :
- python 3
- tkinter module
- from tkinter messagebox module
- from PIL import Image, ImageTk
- nltk

### How this Script works :
- User just need to download the file and run the text_summarizer.py on their local system.
- Now a GUI window will appear, where user will be able to see START and EXIT button.
- When user clicks on the START button main text summarizing application will open, where user can enter any huge paragraph or text and can summarize it.
- Thus this script will segment the given paragraph into sentences which are easy to read and understand in real life.
- Also there is a CLEAR button, clicking on which user can clears the text area.
- Also there is an EXIT button, clicking on which exit dialog box appears asking for the permission of the user for closing the window.

### Purpose :
- This scripts helps user to easily summarize the huge paragraph or text for better readability.

### Compilation Steps :
- Install tkinter, PIL, nltk
