# Alzheimer-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by a decline in cognitive
functions with no validated disease modifying treatment. It is critical for timely treatment to detect AD in
its earlier stage before clinical manifestation. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage
between cognitively normal older adults and AD. To predict conversion from MCI to probable AD. It is
difficult to decide which approach to use for obtaining satisfactory results in the general case. Based on
these considerations, the aim of the present work is to provide a large experimental comparison for
evaluating the effect of the machine learning approaches applied to different classification schemes.
The experiments provide a broad overview of the results obtainable on standard Alzheimer disease
datasets with different characteristics in terms of the number of features. We developed an integrative
framework that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also
longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers obtained from the
Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). The proposed framework integrated
longitudinal data.
This report presents work of our minor project “Predicting Alzheimer Disease Using Machine Learning
Algorithms”. This project shows the implementation of a different machine learning algorithms on
ADNI datasets.
