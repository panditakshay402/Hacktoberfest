/*
Given n boards of different lengths represented by an array arr of size n, and m painters,
 you need to determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards. Each painter paints a contiguous segment of boards.
 Constraints:

A painter can only paint continuous segments of boards.
Each painter takes the same amount of time to paint a unit length of the board.
You have to minimize the maximum time taken by a painter to paint their assigned boards.
Input:
An integer n representing the number of boards.
An integer m representing the number of painters.
An array arr[] of size n, where each element arr[i] represents the length of the i-th board.
Output:
Return the minimum time required to paint all the boards such that no painter is overloaded with work.
