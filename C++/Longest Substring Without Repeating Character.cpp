3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Intiuation :
  Intuition is strightforward and simple, we track the frequencey and as we know we can't use string to track longest substring without repeating characters, as poping a char from front of string is not in O(1) which could be optimized by deque approch.

Approch :
    1) At first we initialize a unordered_map to track the frequncy and then.
    2) We initialize deque for pushing the characters and if temp > res we update our res deque to temp as we need longest substring here.
    3) And while loop is used to reduce the frequency from front doing i++ and removing charecters from temp deque as we no longer need them.
    4) return res.size() as we only need size not string.

Time Complexity :
  O(N)

Space Complexity :
  O(N)

I hope this helps to understand.
Thank you!!
