367. Valid Perfect Square (question)

Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

Example 1:

Input: num = 16 Output: true Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer. Example 2:

Input: num = 14 Output: false Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 231 - 1
